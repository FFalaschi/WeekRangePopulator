# Week Range Populator
As a project manager I usually find myself creating manually ranges for weeks in the format [dd/mm/yyy - dd/mm/yyy] and could not find anything to automate this given a starting week number.

So this Script does exactly that given a cell, a year and a week number populates the row that cell belongs to with weekly ranges starting on Monday to Sunday.
